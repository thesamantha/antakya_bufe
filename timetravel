1970 bad thing happens
1972 person born in bad world
1988 person travels back to 1970
1970 person stops bad thing from happening
1970 person travels back to 1988
1988 everything fine, because the thing that happened at 1970 changed rest of events

But if the person had traveled back to 1970 and changed the bad thing, then in 1988 the world wouldn't have been bad in the first place, so there would be no reason to travel back to 1970.

Or you can say that by traveling back and changing this one thing, you place the universe on a new path in time from 1970 onwards, and then jump to year 1988 on this new path. But allowing that your birth would even happen on this new path, once you come to year 1988, there would be two versions of yourself in the world.

Also, how does traveling forward in time and seeing yourself make sense?

This baby is taken back in time and placed on a doorstep.
But the baby's mother would have had to be there too, herself a baby, because she was a separate entity who was placed on a doorstep at this same time.
So there would have been two babies on the doorstep. 

If Jane is 20 years old in 1970, it means she was born 20 years ago. 20 years ago Jane was lying on a doorstep. So 20 years ago somebody put her there. If in 1970 somebody travels back 20 years and goes to this doorstep, he or she would see Jane lying there.

The question "Where did it start?" isn't actually that mysterious. We know it didn't start when Jane
